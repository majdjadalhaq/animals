The tiger (*Panthera tigris*) is the largest living cat species and is renowned for its striking orange coat with black stripes, which provide excellent camouflage in its natural forested habitats. Tigers are solitary and territorial animals, primarily found across parts of Asia including India, Russiaâ€™s Far East, and Southeast Asia. They are powerful predators, preying mainly on large mammals such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo. Tigers are strong swimmers and often cross rivers and lakes in search of prey or territory. Their populations have suffered from habitat loss, poaching for their pelts and body parts, and conflicts with humans, making them endangered despite extensive conservation efforts.
