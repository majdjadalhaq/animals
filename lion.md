The lion (*Panthera leo*) is a large, muscular cat native to Africa and India, often called the "king of the jungle." Lions live in social groups called prides that usually consist of related females, their offspring, and a small number of adult males. Known for their majestic manes and powerful roars, male lions use their manes to intimidate rivals and attract mates. Lions are apex predators and primarily hunt large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeest, and buffalo. They use cooperative hunting strategies that rely on teamwork. Despite their strength and social structure, lions face threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching, causing their populations to decline significantly.
