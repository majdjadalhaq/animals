Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth and belong to the family Elephantidae. There are three species: the African bush elephant, African forest elephant, and Asian elephant. Recognizable by their long trunks, large ears, and tusks, elephants use their trunks for breathing, grasping objects, drinking water, and communicating. They are highly intelligent, exhibiting complex social behaviors such as cooperation, empathy, and mourning their dead. Elephants live in matriarchal herds and have excellent memories, which help them navigate long distances to find food and water. They are herbivores, feeding on grasses, leaves, bark, and fruit, consuming up to 150 kilograms daily. Despite their majesty, elephants face serious threats from poaching for ivory and habitat destruction, making conservation critical for their survival.
